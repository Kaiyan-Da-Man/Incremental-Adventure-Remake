The UNT CSE machine can be used to run our files

To compile our files and begin running them, a simple g++ *.cpp command is needed to compile and a ./a.out command is needed to run the files.

In our files, a user input of (1-4) will be needed to choose which stats to improve.

After that, the program will execute itself indefinitely, until a stop command of ctrl c is given.
